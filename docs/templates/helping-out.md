There is several ways you can help making YAGPDB better, you don't have to know any coding to help!

 - Writing documentation. The bot needs Documentation! See further below for more info on writing documentation.
 - Writing code.
 - Helping out other people in discord.
 - Fix whatever typos and grammar error you find (there are many of them)
 - Buy the ad space

### Writing Documentation

YAGPDB is definitely one of the more complicated bots out there, and the reason as stated before for that is i prefer combustibility and security over looks, therefor a lot of documentation is needed for people to fully utilize and understand the features the bot provides.

TODO: Simple guide on writing docs

### Contributing code

The bot is written in go, and the web interface is using plain HTML with bootstrap and some small javascript here and there. If you want to make a contribution like fix a bug, add a feature and so on you should probably notify me first by making a issue or sending me a message on discord so that you don't waste your time in case i was also working on that.
