The go template engine is used for YAGPDB's custom commands and in various other places with custom messages.
This page aims to help you to get the most out of templates and custom commands.

Put {{"{{"}}...{{"}}"}} around the names like that: `{{"{{"}}.User.Username{{"}}"}}`

### Quick intro

Invoking functions: `{{"{{"}}add 1 2{{"}}"}} = 3?`

Printing variables: `Hello {{"{{"}}.User.Username{{"}}"}}!`
    
Assigning variables: ` {{"{{"}}$stupidUser := .User{{"}}"}}!`

Note: Variables assigned in the scope block will be forgotten once `{{"{{"}}end{{"}}"}}` is reached.

For branching (if statements and such) look below.

### Branching
| Case | Example |
| --- | --- |
| Basic if | `{{"{{"}}if (condition){{"}}"}}{{"{{"}}end{{"}}"}}`
| And  | `{{"{{"}}if and (cond1) (cond2) (cond3){{"}}"}}` |
| Or   | `{{"{{"}}if or (cond1) (cond2) (cond3){{"}}"}}` |
| Equals  | `{{"{{"}}if eq .Channel.ID "########"{{"}}"}}` |
| Not Equals  | `{{"{{"}}if ne .Channel.ID "#######"{{"}}"}}` |
| Less than | `{{"{{"}}if lt (len .Args) 5{{"}}"}}` |
| Greater Than  | `{{"{{"}}if gt (len .Args) 1{{"}}"}}` |
| Else if | `{{"{{"}}if (case statement}} {{"{{"}}else if (case statement}} {{"{{"}}end{{"}}"}}` |
| Else | `{{"{{"}}if (case statement}} {{"{{"}}else}} output here {{"{{"}}end{{"}}"}}` |


### Snippets
* `<@{{"{{"}}.User.ID{{"}}"}}>` Outputs a mention to the user with the user ID, doesn't output an ID
* `{{"{{"}}if hasRoleName "funrole"{{"}}"}} This will only show if the member has a role with name "funrole" {{"{{"}}end{{"}}"}}`
* `{{"{{"}}if gt (len .Args) 1{{"}}"}} {{"{{"}}index .Args 1{{"}}"}} {{"{{"}}end{{"}}"}}` Will display your first input if input was given 
* `{{"{{"}}if eq .Channel.ID ‚Äú#######‚Äù{{"}}"}}` Will only show in Channel #####
* `{{"{{"}}if ne  .User.ID ‚Äú#######‚Äù{{"}}"}}` Will ignore if user ID ##### uses command
* `{{"{{"}}$d := randInt 10{{"}}"}}` Store the random int into variable $d 
* `{{"{{"}}$d := randInt 10{{"}}"}}` Store the random int into variable $d 
* `{{"{{addReactions .CmdArgs}}"}}` Adds the emoji following a trigger as reactions

### How to get a role ID

Use the `listroles` command. 

### exec and execAdmin functions

The format is `exec/execAdmin command argument1 argument2...`

Accepted arguments are: numbers, strings, string arrays/slices and also User objects!

I'll start off with an example:

`{{"{{"}}exec "reverse" "123" {{"}}"}}`

Lets break it down:

 - exec: the function
 - "reverse": the command were executing
 - "123": the argument were providing to the command

This executes the `reverse` command, and puts the output in it's place, in the above example, it would be replaced with `321`

It would be the same as sending `-reverse 123` in the chat.


A more complicated example:

`{{"{{"}}exec "giverep" (userArg 232658301714825217) {{"}}"}}`

This will make the user who triggered the command give rep to the user with the id above. 
The `userArg` function can be used to retrieve a user from a mention string or id.

**execAdmin**: 

execAdmin executes commands as if the bot was the one invoking them, meaning if someone without kick permissions triggered a custom command, and that custom command used `execAdmin` with the kick command, it would go through fine.

Example: Say you want to mute everyone that triggers a custom command for 1 minute:

`{{"{{"}}execAdmin "mute" .User 1 "You triggered the evil custom command" {{"}}"}}`

The only new thing here is were using execAdmin instead of exec, this works even if the user that triggers it dosen't have admin.
