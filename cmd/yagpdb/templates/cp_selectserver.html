        <h3>One year! <small>21st jul 2012</small></h3>
        <p>It's around one year since i started the development of YAGPDB and it's been neat. I decided to make a survey to give you the ability to leave some feedback!</p>
        <a class="btn btn-primary" href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf6BYGCJBC05bYH4e7s3YARDbm1Xfr4or2ll5anwXjMkWQjog/viewform?usp=sf_link">Take survery</a>

        <h3>Version 0.21.0->0.21.5 <small>0.21.6: 26th jul 2017</small></h3>
        <p>I've pushed a couple bugfix updates to the bot since the last major update</p>
        <p>If you come across any weird behaviour or issues please let me know as soon as possible by joining the support server above or <a href="https://github.com/jonas747/yagpdb/issues">opening an issue.</a></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Fix deadlocks resulting form the new member fetching queue, if your control panel was inaccessible and some bot funcionality was not working this may have been the cause</li>
            <li>Fix deadlocks resulting from new central templating system, if your custom command used exec or you used the streaming notifications plugin you may have been affected and you may have been unable to access the control panel and certain commands</li>
            <li>Fix the new member fetcher sometimes attempting to fetch the same member twice</li> 
            <li><b>0.21.4</b>: Fix some wrong behaviour in reputation, the takerep command specifically</li> 
            <li><b>0.21.4</b>: More updates to the documentation pages, thanks <b>Ryvid</b> and <b>timcampy118</b> for the contributions</li> 
            <li><b>0.21.4</b>: Made the youtube page slightly more user friendly</li> 
            <li><b>0.21.4</b>: Fixed a bug in the streaming plugin where it wouldn't retry giving the streaming role after the first error</li> 
            <li><b>0.21.5</b>: Added <code>setrep</code> command which i forgot about last update.</li> 
            <li><b>0.21.6</b>: Commands are now limited to 1m of execution time, this is mostly in regarding to commands that sends huge responses, if they go on for more than 1 minute.</li> 
            <li><b>0.21.6</b>: You can now only execute 1 instance of a command at once, it will queue up and start executing the command after the other one finishes if you try to do them both at once, this and the above change was introduced because it was a target for attackers making the bot crash.</li> 
        </ul>

        <h3>Version 0.21 <small>11th jul 2017</small></h3>
        <p>A mostly fix update which fixes most broken stuff in the bot and adds some fresh new functionality aswell</p>
        <p>I've set up a Patreon for the bot <a href="https://www.patreon.com/yagpdb">here</a> (yes that is me)</p>
        <p>Again, thanks to <b>Ryvid</b> for his contributions, i am extremely happy to receive contributions even if it's only documentation, documentation is one thing that this bot lacks a lot and that I'm not very good at</p>
        <p>If you find any issues, or want anything added, be sure to <a href="https://github.com/jonas747/yagpdb/issues">open a issue about it</a>, notifying me in person works and all but i often forget about small things like typos.</p>

                            <li><b>Redid Reputation:</b> As a result all reputation has been wiped, i'm sorry about this but the bot is in alpha. Heres a short breakdown of the features of the new reputation system:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Reputation admins have full access to set anyones reputation to anything</li>
                                    <li>Users can give more than 1 rep</li>
                                    <li>The points can be renamed to whatever you want (for example, meatballs)</li>
                                    <li>You can set up: required give/receive and blacklisted give/receive roles</li>
                                    <li>Improved auto-detection, it will now catch thank(s) and ty, a mention is still required for it to trigger. This auto-detection can also be disabled now.</li>
                                    <li>An actual leaderboard</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li><b>Added doc pages.</b> There are only a limited amount of pages at this exact moment, but they will get written as time goes on</li>
                            <li>Added command to delete warnings: <code>delwarning (id)</code> and <code>clearwarning @user</code></li>
                            <li>Added ability to blacklist creation of logs from certain channels</li>
                            <li>Added sharding, since were (somehow) nearing the 2.5k single shard limit.</li>
                            <li>Started first steps to transitioning towards another state tracker that might give more consistent results when you're interacting with the bot</li>
                            <li>Scheduled events now execute every 10 seconds (as opposed to 60) (means more responsive reminders and unmutes and shit)</li>
                            <li>Fixed reminders command displayed stuff like 1 hour and 59 minutes, the actual time was correct but it just showed the time wrong</li>
                            <li>Added the ability for people with manage messages to view deleted messages, aswell as everyone (they are toggles)</li>
                            <li>Made things more reponsive in general to changes, in the past when giving someone a role that gives them acces to the control panel it could take up to a minute before that takes effect, now thats instant, although changing permissions on existing roles wont kick fully in within 10 seconds still (not sure if i want to disable caching completely on this part or not)</li>
